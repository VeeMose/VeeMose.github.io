# Valerie's Practice GitHub site

This is where I will practice using Markdown.  For instance, I'm going to write my name in **bold**  ~~**Valerie**~~, nah, let's do italics: *Valerie*.

## ASSIGNMENT

*We, apparently, are supposed to overwrite this with a journal but everything is too precious to me to overwrite so I'm adding the journal below.  (I want to link to the journal but can't figure out how to do internal links)*

The assignment in Canvas and what Brian said in class differ somewhat.  Are we supposed to write an 
- About Me page? 

 *OR*
- Talk about the Growth Mindset?

## Let's make a chart!
**Living in Capitol Hill**

Pro | Con
-------|--------
Close to everything | Crap parking
Love my old house   | I'll be the last to live there
Cal Anderson & Volunteer Parks | Shootings
Light Rail station | Noisy buses

## More stuff
Turns out you can use Emojis!

Ahhhh...... :relaxed:

Oh wait, I better be wary, there might be :alien: lurking :exclamation::exclamation:
>>> Oh shoot!  These emojis show up in the preview but not on the live page.  

## Last thing, cuz it's late and I'm tired

##JOURNAL

Here's is a checklist for my journal:
- [ ] I need to learn how to make internal markdown links
- [ ] I need to ACP this thang
- [ ] I need to breathe
